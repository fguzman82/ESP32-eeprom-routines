# ESP32 EEPROM Routines

## Description
This project demonstrates how to use EEPROM with the ESP32 microcontroller. It includes routines to read from and write to the EEPROM, providing a way to store persistent data on the ESP32.

## Features
- Read and write data to EEPROM
- Store persistent data across resets
- Simple and easy-to-use routines

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- ESP32 development board
- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
- USB cable to connect ESP32 to your computer

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fguzman82/ESP32-eeprom-routines.git
    cd ESP32-eeprom-routines
    ```

2. Open the project in your development environment (Arduino IDE or PlatformIO).

3. Install the necessary libraries:
    - EEPROM

### Usage
1. Connect the ESP32 to your computer using a USB cable.

2. Open the `esp32-eeprom-routines.ino` file in your development environment.

3. Upload the code to your ESP32.

4. Open the Serial Monitor to interact with the EEPROM routines and see the stored data.
